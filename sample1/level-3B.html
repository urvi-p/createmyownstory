    <h1>Sample story</h1>
    
    <p>
      You cautiously approach the birdlike shape and see that it 
      is indeed a bird, albeit a mechanical one. Its black eyes 
      shine in the moonlight as it opens its mouth and chirps again.
      A small red button lights up on its back. You squint and read
      the words around it: “push in case of emergency.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Do you...
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A. <a href="level-3C.html">Push the button.</a> You’re curious what it’ll do.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      B. <a href="level-3D.html">Not push the button.</a> It’s not an emergency, is it?
    </p>
