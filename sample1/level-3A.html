    <h1>Sample story</h1>
    
    <p>
      You yelp and scramble out of bed, then run out of your house 
      without looking back. You stay at your neighbor’s place for 
      the night and the next morning, you enter your bedroom 
      carefully. The only sign that anything out of the ordinary 
      happened are the slivers of glass on the floor. You shake 
      your head. It was probably nothing but a stray baseball. But 
      for a while, a question lingers in your mind… what if?
