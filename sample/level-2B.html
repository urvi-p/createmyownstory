    <p>
      You get up and open the window. Cold air rushes in and you 
      shiver, but you forget about the cold when you see what was 
      making the chirping sound. A mechanical bird is sitting on 
      your windowsill, its black eyes shining in the moonlight. It 
      opens its mouth and chirps again, then a small red button 
      lights up on its back. You squint and read the words around 
      it: “push in case of emergency.”

      Do you...

    <p>
      A. <a href="level-3C.html">Push the button.</a> You’re curious what it’ll do.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      B. <a href="level-3D.html">Not push the button.</a> It’s not an emergency, is it?
