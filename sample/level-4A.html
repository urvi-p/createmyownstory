    <h1>Sample story</h1>
    
    <p>
      You walk to the computer. Its screen glows softly and a 
      comfortable chair materializes in front of it. You sit down 
      and watch as a message prints on the screen… “birdcage - b.” 
      You frown, puzzled. Looking around the computer, you notice 
      a deck of cards. Strangely enough, when you open it, it only 
      contains aces. You think for a moment, then rearrange the 
      letters of “birdcage” in your head. Without the b, the 
      letters form “cridage” or maybe “race dig”... Suddenly the 
      answer hits you. “Ace grid!” you exclaim. But what exactly 
      does that mean?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Do you...
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A. <a href="level-5A.html">Use the aces</a> to form a grid on the computer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      B. <a href="level-5B.html">Type in “ace grid”</a> onto the computer.
