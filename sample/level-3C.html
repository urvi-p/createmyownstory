      You push the red button. The bird starts to glow with a 
      blinding light and you have to close your eyes. Before you 
      can open them, however, your ears are assaulted by a 
      cacophony of chirps, tweets, and mournful calls. You look 
      around you and find that your familiar bedroom is gone. You 
      are surrounded by birdcages, spiraling up to the high domed 
      ceiling. Before you can take it all in, the mechanical bird 
      chirps impatiently and flies to a computer in the center of 
      the room. Behind the computer, you notice a plain gray door. 
      It’s marked “Do not enter."
