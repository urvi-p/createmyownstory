    <h1>Sample story</h1>
    
    <p>
      You pick up the cards and arrange them in a grid on the 
      computer screen. You wait a few minutes, and just when 
      you’re about to try something else, the computer beeps and 
      glows pale green. The mechanical bird chirps happily as, 
      with a loud clanking sound, the birdcage doors swing open. 
      You watch in awe as the birds spiral out of their cages and 
      escape through the “do not enter” door, which is now wide 
      open. The mechanical bird nods to you then flies out with 
      the flock as the computer starts to glow with a blinding 
      light. When the light fades, you’re back in your bedroom, 
      somehow holding the deck of aces. You turn over a card and 
      smile at the image of a mechanical bird.
